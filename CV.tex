\section*{Skills and Interests}


\textbf{Programming Languages:} Unity, C, C\#, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, HTML, CSS\\
\noindent\textbf{Games Development:} I have competed in game jams, developing games in Unity in anywhere from 48 hours to 14 days. 
To learn more about the industry, I have read game development blogs and attended the Games Careers Week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Guitar:} I taught myself guitar to keep busy during the Covid-19 lockdowns.\\  
\noindent\textbf{Archery:} I was a member of Audco Archers, an archery club based where Archery GB train; consequently,
I have trained with and been inspired by the dedication of Olympic and Paralympic archers.\\
