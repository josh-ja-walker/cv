\section*{Projects}

\project{Dill \normalfont{(Group Project)}}{2025}{Rust, Scala, Tauri, Laminar}{
    Built a \textbf{interactive cross-platform debugger} for the parser combinator library Parsley (utilised in Imperial's compilers coursework), 
    working throughout semester to deliver an app meeting both the brief of our supervisor and the needs of our fellow undergraduates.
}

\project{Lettuce Eat \normalfont{(Group Project)}}{2024}{Flutter, Firebase, Dart}{
    Studied \textbf{Human-Centered Design} with the Royal College of Art in order to build a recipe-sharing social media app for students,
    using user interviews to ensure our product was commercially viable and practical for our users.
}

\project{Sorts TUI}{2024}{Rust}{
    Developed an in-terminal utility for visualising sorting algorithms, built as as an exercise in understanding \textbf{algorithmic complexity}.
}

\project{Portfolio Website}{2024}{JavaScript, React, CSS}{
    Designed and developed my own portfolio website to showcase skills and experience gained through university and solo projects.
}

\project{WACC \normalfont{(Group Project)}}{2024}{Rust}{
    Built an \textbf{optimising compiler} in Rust using the Chumsky parser library, compiling initially to an 
    internal intermediate representation to allow for code generation into both Arm32 and Intel x86-64 assembly code.
}

\project{Pintos \normalfont{(Group Project)}}{2023}{C}{
    Extended a simple \textbf{operating system} with features such as synchronisation primitives, 
    system calls and virtual memory. Explored foundational concepts of OS architectures and delved into the
    pre-existing codebase to research their practical implementations. 
}

\project{Weather Wallpaper}{2022 - 2024}{Rust}{
    Built a command-line \textbf{wallpaper engine} that changes a user's desktop wallpaper to reflect local weather, learning the fundamentals 
    of using the REST API to access online data.
}

\project{ARMv8 Assembler and Emulator}{2023}{C} {
    Implemented an emulator to simulate execution of an \textbf{AArch64} binary on a Raspberry PI; developed in tandem with an \textbf{assembler},
    converting assembly source files to a binary executable ready for emulation. 
}

% \project{Origame}{2022 - 2024}{Unity, C\#}{
%     Developed a 2D puzzle platformer game for A-Level coursework - attained an A/A* grade and expanded further after submission. 
% }

% \project{Painball}{2021}{Unity, C\#}{
%     Pinball-platformer developed in 7 days for a game jam, the theme of which was Foddian: 
%     participants were tasked with emulating the frustration of popular Bennett Foddy games.
% }
